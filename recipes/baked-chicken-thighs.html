        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simple baked chicken thigh recipe using cooking spray and seasoning blend. It is designed 
            to be very easy, for those days where food needs to get made in as few steps as humanly
            possible. Just spray the chicken, or use oil if you prefer, pour the seasoning on, and 
            then just throw them in the oven. Chicken thighs are easy because you can "overcook" them 
            and they'll still come out juicy and tasty
        </p>
        <p>You can add any seasoning blend you desire. Adobo seasoning is what I grew up with and tastes
            really good, but I usually use Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning along with some Chef Paul 
            Prudhomme's Poultry magic, and add garlic and onion powder. This is just a basic template 
            for a meat dish that tastes good and is very easy to do.

            <li>Preheat oven for 425 degrees</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs on aluminum lined baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray</li>
            <li>Spray chicken with cooking spray, or coat with oil, and liberally season both sides

                (Preferably 175, dark meat is delicious "overcooked")
