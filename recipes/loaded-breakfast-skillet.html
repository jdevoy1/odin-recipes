        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potatoes, bacon, onions, eggs, and shredded cheese make a hearty and delicious breakfast or brunch dish.</p>
        <p>I have no idea how this tastes, but it is morning and the picture looks delicious</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 russet potatoes, scrubbed, chopped into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
                until crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels; reserve most of the bacon fat 
                in skillet.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onions until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. 
                Add potatoes; toss to coat evenly in bacon fat. Pour in water and cover skillet with a 
                large lid. Cook, checking occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. 
                Add green onions, garlic, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Make 4 wells in the potato mixture using a wooden spoon, revealing the bottom of the skillet. 
                Crack an egg into each well; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cooked bacon and Cheddar 
                cheese over the entire skillet. Replace lid; cook until egg whites are set and yolks are still 
                runny, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
