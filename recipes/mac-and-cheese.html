        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple baked mac and cheese recipe by Chef John. It uses cheddar cheese
            and panko to form a crispy crust, and includes freshly ground nutmeg, cayenne, and 
            the unpronounceable Worcestershire sauce. Dijon mustard is used in place of dry mustard. 
            The end result is a filling, savory, and delicious mac and cheese dish. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni 
                in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the 
                bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter starts 
                to foam and bubble, stir in flour; cook on medium heat until flour begins to 
                turn pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Add thyme, cayenne, and white pepper; cook 
                and stir another minute, then whisk in 1 cup milk until smooth. Pour in remaining 
                milk and whisk again. Bring sauce just to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, and nutmeg. Simmer, whisking often, on medium-low 
                heat until thickened, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn heat off, then add 2 1/4 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until melted and combined. Mix 
                in Dijon mustard.</li>
            <li>Transfer macaroni into a casserole dish, then pour in cheese sauce; stir to thoroughly 
                combine pasta with sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix together panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl. Sprinkle 
                mixture over macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
